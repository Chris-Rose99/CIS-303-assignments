AVL Trees Read Me

We were provided with 3 files, AVLClient.java, AVLNode.java, and BSTNode.java. These program perform the 
process of inserting an array of unsorted integers into a Binary Search Tree and an AVL Tree. In order to compile  
this program you must input 'javac AVLClient.java AVLNode.java BSTNode.java'. When running this program you only
need to type 'java AVLClient'. It is important to note that, because of specific instructions for this assignment,
to change to number of integers inserted you must open the client code and change the variable, then recompile it.
The program should produce the height of the array, then the printed tree, and finally the run time. It should produce
this for both the BST and the AVL Tree respectively.
