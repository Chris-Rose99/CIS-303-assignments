Algorithm Analysis Assignment 4b
Ackermann

Problem: The ackermann assignment required us to implement a stack using an Array list or a Link list.
Afterwards use the stack to implement Ackermann's function. We are then asked to compare the 
run times between this method and a recursive method.

Testing Criteria: This program should be given 2 inputs "x y". When running these algorithms it is expected that they produced a solution to ackermanns formula based on the 
inputs and the run time of the program, indicated by "runtime:"

Execution: To compile this the user should input "javac ackermann.java AckermannClient.java"
to run this algorithm the user should input "java AckermannClient x y" where x and y 
are Ackermann(x, y).
